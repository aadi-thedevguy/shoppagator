# Features ‚öôÔ∏è
1.  **Admin Dashboard:** A fully customisable multi-theme(dark/light), multi-lingual admin dashboard where you can add and delete products, manage orders, and reviews and even ban or delete users.  
    You can also modify static content and images of your website on different pages.
2.  **Access Control:** Very granular control over the admin dashboard of your digital store, _meaning_ only **YOU, THE ADMIN** can edit the website, not your users.  
    However any customer can manage their _own orders, reviews and user profile_ from his own dashboard.
3.  **Advanced Security Practices:** Implemented all best-grade security measures like CSRF, CORS, Rate Limiting, and Max Login Attempts to prevent DDOS and other cyber attacks.
4.  **Great UI/UX & SEO optimized:** Developed Clean and smooth UI and functionalities like Reset Password, Email Magic Link, Anonymous Carts and Feedback Forms for a great User Experience.  
    As an Admin you can add a product meta description and image for a better SEO ranking.
5.  **Upcoming Features:** Seller Accounts so anyone can make money by just setting their emails and stripe accounts, The admin can also update and manage categories, Navbar and Footer links.
6.  **For Developers:** If you as a developer want to extend and customise this code, it is very easy to set up.  
    I've included both the dev and production docker files with the repo, just set up your .env file and voila, you can self-host it wherever you want as a standalone node server.
